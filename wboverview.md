# Overview & Getting Started #

WinBuilder is a flexible scripting environment that is well suited to building boot disks and other Windows "Pre-installation Enviroment" (or PE) images. Using special scripts, this program can create different bootable environments based on the source that is used.

There are several [projects](wbprojects.md) available for WinBuilder so please remember to read the instructions found inside each project to understand which sources are compatible and can be used with that project.

Some of the features to expect from WinBuilder include:
  * Many built-in tools to edit and create new scripts
  * Friendly User Interface
  * Scripts that in most cases, can be configured without needing to edit any code (i.e Scriptable GUI components)
  * Most scripts already come included with freeware applications
  * Scripting Language and API specially targeted at Windows PE challenges.
  * Last but not least - A very active community

Getting started with WinBuilder  is easy, since there are many projects that have done most of the work for you. Jump over to the [projects section](wbprojects.md) of this documentation or [directly to the !WinBuilder Project fforums](http://reboot.pro/forum/22/) for more details.
