# Attachments #

Attachments are files that can be included inside your script.

Since script files are meant to be edited by any text editor, these files are encoded into ascii text. This method allows you to add small files along with your scripts in order to keep everything together.

While a script is running you can use some of the following commands to best take advantage of this feature.
